# go-bookstacks

A simple golang service that I have written for learning more about golang. It directs to a page where you can add books either you have read, or TBR. 
It is sort of a basic as of now. As I get to know more stuff, I will keep adding to it. 


To see how this goes, run ```$go build``` in the folder where all the code files of this repository are cloned. 

The $go build will create a binary with the name of the module. (Say, bookstacks)

Then, run ./bookstacks and check for the output in localhost:5000/assets/
